TODO List:

- Split Workers into their own file for readablity.
-- Reduce size of `workerPool.js`

- Optimize CPU usage by reducing pathfinding on every tick (ie. let creep get to final location/give up before checking agian)
-- Cache sources for harvesters and construction sites for builders.
-- Cache sources for energy sites and path for only one to pick up.
-- Just cache everything (pathing, sources, etc.)

- Claim logic for another room.

- Checkers build for extensions around spawn.
-- List the potentials positions (ie: all plain or swamp tiles of the room).
-- Remove tiles which don't fit some arbitrary rules (ie: in your case, filter all tiles where (x + y) % 2 === 0 which will create a checker pattern)
--- Score the remaining tile based, for example, on distance and keep the best one (ie: use (pos) => spawn.pos.getRangeTo(pos) function to score and keep the minimum).

- Automated turret building.
