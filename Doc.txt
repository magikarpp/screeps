TODO List:

- Refactor so that there is Stage logic instead of Scale logic
-- Infrastructure set up (stage 1).
-- Refactor so that theres a worker upper limit once we hit storages (stage 2).
--- Implement `Hauler` worker logic.
---- Once storage is available, hauler should move energy from storage to extensions/spawn.

- Long Distance mining.
-- Manually say which `Direction` to mine from.
-- Ability to add/remove mining (for when it gets taken over [us or otherwise])

- Claim logic for another room.

- Optimize for using as little Creeps as possible.

- More complex army composition and army logic.
-- Different `Formations` for army to choose from.
