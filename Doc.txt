TODO List:
- Implement `Hauler` worker logic.
-- Once storage is available, hauler should move energy from storage to extensions/spawn.
-- Once storage is available, harvesters should move energy to only storage.

- Refactor so that there is Stage logic instead of Scale logic
-- Infrastructure set up (stage 1).
-- Refactor so that theres a worker upper limit once we hit storages (stage 2).

- Long Distance mining.
-- Manually say which `Direction` to mine from.
-- Ability to add/remove mining (for when it gets taken over [us or otherwise])

- Claim logic for another room.

- Checkers build for extensions around spawn.
-- List the potentials positions (ie: all plain or swamp tiles of the room).
-- Remove tiles which don't fit some arbitrary rules (ie: filter all tiles where (x + y) % 2 === 0 which will create a checker pattern)
--- Score the remaining tile based, for example, on distance and keep the best one (ie: use (pos) => spawn.pos.getRangeTo(pos) function to score and keep the minimum).
